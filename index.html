<h3 class="mt-5">About me</h3>
<p>I’m a self-taught junior developer who specializes in website creation using JavaScript and Rails.
   I earned a degree in zoology from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and while I find the hibernation patterns of Columbian ground squirrels fascinating,
   I’ve found that programming has just a few more practical applications. My motivation for pursuing coding as a profession stems from a lifelong
   interest in tinkering and building, from handmade longbows, to blacksmithing in a homemade coal forge, to web development. That interest continues
   to drive me towards meticulously high standards. You name it, I find the best way to build it.

   And, if I can build it from a mountain in Fiji or the Nā Pali Coast in Kauai, even better.
   My dream job will allow me to travel, so if I can contribute to your project from over here - wherever that happens to be - I’m already invested in doing the best job possible.
   Just give me a call!

</strong>
  <p>About: Tavern is a whisky encyclopedia app through which users can rate, review, and learn about different whisky types and distilleries,
     as well as follow and connect with other users.
     My co-developers and I created Tavern as a resource for enthusiasts looking to find their next favorite whisky.
     Since every whisky has its own unique flavor profile, trying to find ones that match your tastes can quickly become an expensive investment;
     instead of playing a tipsy, high-dollar game of trial and error, Tavern allows users to research whiskies along ten of their most common flavor profiles.
     This provides a convenient picture of a whisky’s general flavor as well as consistent measurements.
     Users can also leave reviews to share their thoughts and comment on more specific flavors, like “coffee grounds” or “toasted cactus plums.”
     Meanwhile, Tavern’s social aspect allows users to follow others with similar tastes, providing an easy, less expensive way to gauge how they might feel about their next bottle,
     as well as learn about different distilleries and expand their knowledge through what others are drinking.
  </p>
<p>My Role: With a team of three other developers, I co-created Tavern using Git version control and was responsible for Tavern’s frontend development.
   I built the UX/UI using Reactjs for its efficiency concerning data visualization, and using React’s virtual Dom, I wrote several component building blocks in order to create responsive web pages that require no reloading.
   As a huge fan of JSX, I used JavaScript in the HTML, my personal favorite for its intuitive feel and adaptability.
   I chose Apollo to handle state management and to make graphQL queries and mutations. To best fit our ideal aesthetic, I used react-semantic-ui, bootstrap 4, and Chart.js, amongst various other libraries.

</strong>
<p class="start-text">About: Aggo is a productivity and life planning app for iOS.
  In contrast to typical daily planners, Aggo breaks down larger goals - career aspirations, for example - into visualized daily steps.
  It’s intended to help users create simple pathways toward ambitions that might otherwise feel unrealistic or out of reach.
  By beginning with the end goal and working backward, Aggo takes the intimidation out of starting lofty endeavors, turning “dreams”
  into achievable milestones and daily goals, which are then rendered into a straightforward graphic.
  </p>
  <p>
  My Role: I co-created Aggo with a team of two other developers. My primary responsibility concerned writing the menu logic for the UI.
  Building off my previous experience with Tavern, I chose to use React Native for the project, an attractive option since it simplified the process of deploying Aggo on both the Apple Store and Google Play.
  For state management, we used mobx state tree, which we chose for its immutable approach and better readability for shared code.

</strong>
<p>About: “This or That” is a social polling web app and a personal project. I built it for a simple reason: my fondness for silly questions and hypothetical scenarios.
   Along the lines of “what if” or “would you rather,” “This or That” is designed purely for entertainment value and includes questions from the tamer,
   “Have perfect at-will recall, or see five minutes into the future?” to the more absurd, “Pick one as a pet: a cat with eight spider legs, or a cat-sized spider with four cat legs?”
   Users can sign up to create their own inquiries or answer others users’, and the results are then displayed as a bar chart.
   The web app also includes a social function through which users can follow their friends and stay updated on new polls via their feed.
</p>
<p>Development: “This or That” was my first full-stack web application, which I built using Postgres, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript/jQuery. Despite my fondness for JavaScript,
   I chose to write the project using Ruby on Rails rather than use node or express. It gave me the opportunity to better acquaint myself with the language,
   and it also provided a full-web framework with full migration support and scaffolding, which helped cut down the project’s development time.
   In creating “This or “That,” I found that I enjoyed Rails as an opinionated framework that streamlined my coding, structuring it via CRUD architecture.
   Though I initially struggled with writing the integration and unit tests,
   I learned a lot from “This or That” as my first solo project, and I found both the learning experience and the quality of the result worthwhile.
   Designing the app also gave me the chance to familiarize myself with security concerns from a backend perspective. By writing the user authentication from scratch rather than using a ruby gem-like device,
   I gained a better understanding of encryption processes through the construction of a password digest using bcrypt.

  <h3>Fun Stuff</h3>
  <p>I'm an avid fisherman and I love adventuring around looking for new water.
     I’m also passionate about blacksmithing. Using a hand-forged tool for projects or fishing trips is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world.
